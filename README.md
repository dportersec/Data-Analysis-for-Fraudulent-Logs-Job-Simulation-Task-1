# Data Analysis for Fraudulent Logs â€“ Commonwealth Bank Job Simulation Task 1

## Overview
This project is part of the Commonwealth Bank cybersecurity job simulation. In **Task 1**, I performed data analysis to detect fraudulent activities within a transactional dataset using Splunk.

### Project Objectives:
- Analyze fraudulent logs using Splunk.
- Create dashboards to visualize key fraud metrics such as fraud by category, age, and merchant.
- Extract insights from raw data logs and present them using clear and intuitive visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Splunk**: For data analysis and dashboard creation.
- **Data Analysis**: Pattern recognition, log filtering, and fraud detection.
- **Visualization**: Bar charts, statistics panels, and custom dashboards.

## Key Accomplishments:
- Created custom queries to detect fraudulent activities based on factors such as category, gender, and age.
- Designed a comprehensive dashboard to visualize fraud trends across various categories and demographics.
- Analyzed gender-specific fraud patterns and generated reports for further investigation.

## Dashboard and Visualizations:
You can view the dashboard and graphs generated in this task in the [Fraud Detection Dashboard PDF](https://github.com/dportersec/Data-Analysis-for-Fraudulent-Logs-Job-Simulation-Task-1/blob/main/fraud_detection_dashboard-2024-08-19.pdf).

## How to Run the Project:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use Splunk to upload the provided dataset (`prepared_data.csv`) and apply the provided queries to analyze the data.
3. Customize or recreate the dashboard using the saved queries and visualizations.

## Next Task:
The next task in the simulation involves **Incident Response**. Stay tuned for updates!
